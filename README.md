# AI Pair Programmer

Use the hand button beside Reply to request a chance to interject. The agent
finishes the current speech and safe action before handing you the floor. Press
it again while waiting to lower your hand; once the floor is yours, press it
to focus Reply. The panel shows "What's up?" and, when speech is available,
plays the same cue. Other pauses still apply.

The fixed voice prompt is generated on first use and cached in memory, without
conversation history. Relevant voice, synthesis, privacy or credential changes
invalidate it; the next use creates a new clip. Replays make no new synthesis
request. Generating a cloud clip may use account credits.

Pair narration connects relevant choices to earlier verified work; ask for a
teaching style for more concept explanations without compulsory exercises.

AI Pair lets a coding agent work in your editor at a pace you can follow,
while you interrupt, ask questions, or take over the keyboard. This fork adds
speech, local audio routing, and additional controls to the original project.

## Get started

Install **AI Pair** (`mattyv.ai-pair`) and **AI Pair Local Audio**
(`mattyv.ai-pair-local-audio`) as VSIX files from the same
[GitHub release](https://github.com/mattyv/ai-pair/releases/latest). For a
development build, use both artifacts from the same [Build VSIX workflow run](https://github.com/mattyv/ai-pair/actions/workflows/build-vsix.yml).
Install AI Pair in the workspace and the audio companion locally on the
computer with your speakers. In an SSH or container window, install the
companion on the local side. Reload the VS Code window after installing or
updating both extensions.

Run **AI Pair: Set Up Agent** in the command palette, select your agent, then
restart it so it reloads its MCP configuration. Open a project in VS Code,
start the agent in that folder, and ask it to pair. See [Connect your
agent](#connect-your-agent) for supported agents and configuration details.

## Speech and audio

Optional **Speech context and delivery cues** can be enabled in Pair Settings.
For supported models, the provider receives up to three previously completed
agent utterances, bounded to 500 Unicode code points, to improve continuity.
Previous context requires OpenRouter Zero Data Retention; ordinary narration
and supported delivery cues remain available without it.
This is plain previous agent narration, not chat history; it is held only for
the current session. OpenRouter ElevenLabs v4 supports previous text and
delivery cues; v3, v3 conversational and v4 turbo support delivery cues only.
Other models use ordinary speech. This does not enable speech, change the
provider, add a microphone, or create a voice chat.

Speech is off by default. Enable narration in Pair Settings or with the toolbar
speaker button. The speaker status shows off, unchecked, starting, ready, or
unavailable; hover for details. Ready reflects available cached checks, not
proof that you can hear audio or that a cloud account is available. The toolbar
button also mutes narration. Use **Preview voice** to test your selected voice
and output; only you can confirm audibility.

Choose a provider in Settings:

-   **Kokoro** is local and needs no API key. Run **Download Kokoro model**
    to install the pinned CPU model (about 94 MB), then preview a voice.
    The local companion's Kokoro requires a Linux x64 desktop with glibc.
    On a Mac, use the main extension without the companion for local Kokoro;
    remote speech requires the companion. Mac main-extension builds support
    Intel and Apple silicon.
    Enabled Kokoro prepares at extension load without downloading, speaking,
    or making a cloud request.
-   **Kokoro GPU** is experimental on supported Linux x64 systems. Select
    **Auto** or **GPU**, then **Set up GPU**. Setup requires the CPU model and
    can download a pinned GPU model (about 326 MB). Auto may fall back to CPU;
    GPU mode fails closed. One AMD system has been tested; wider hardware and
    listening validation remain open.
-   **ElevenLabs** uses a key saved through the secure VS Code prompt. Load
    account voices, select one, and preview it. Available voices depend on the
    account. Narration and previews use account credits.
-   **OpenRouter** uses its own securely saved key. Load the account's eligible
    speech models and advertised voices dynamically, then choose PCM or MP3.
    The **ZDR** filter narrows the eligible models and requests OpenRouter's
    ZDR routing policy; account Safety Retention settings still apply. The
    catalog does not establish format, voice, or standard text-input
    compatibility, so a listed model can reject a request. Provider-specific
    parameters are not inferred. Previews and narration use account credits;
    there is no automatic provider fallback.

The companion stores its keys and models locally; generated audio and keys are
not sent to the workspace extension. Saving a key does not enable speech. Choose
**Speech output** for the system default or an explicit local device. Linux
playback requires `pw-play`, `pw-dump`, and `setpriv`; native playback helpers
ship for macOS and Windows. Device availability and audible output depend on the
local environment.

**Listening speed** adjusts local playback without changing pitch, separately
from a provider's synthesis speed and from code and reading pace. It applies to
the next narration or preview and makes no additional provider request. Rates
other than 1 are experimental and have only been checked with synthetic
signals, not human listening.

By default, playback waits for spoken narration before the next action. Agents
can choose `speech_mode: "continue"` to let commentary play over subsequent
work; later spoken messages remain ordered. Questions that need an answer use
`"wait"` followed by `listen`: audio finishing is not an answer. Ending the
session stops outstanding speech. Short messages are eligible for narration;
messages over 45 words or 280 characters are displayed without speech, and the
agent can choose silence.

OpenRouter's compact toolbar subtotal uses provider-confirmed speech costs.
It is approximate when compactly displayed and may be incomplete when costs
are missing or still being retrieved. Hover or focus it for precise confirmed
amounts and details; it is not a complete account bill.

## Pair controls

The panel offers **Run once**, **Allow this command**, **Allow all for
session**, and **Skip**. The middle choices grant session approval for that
command or for all commands, respectively.
**Require command approval** clears session grants and restores confirmation;
an optional approval sound uses the system default output. The programmer can
interrupt by replying or editing, take the keyboard with **My turn**, and hand
it back. The agent can comment as navigator when useful and should build on
user edits. At task completion it summarizes in Pair and listens until the
programmer explicitly ends the session.

In Claude Code, `/pair:demo` runs a guided Pair session and `/pair:diagnose`
checks connection, command, speech, and audio status. The legacy
`/mcp__pair__demo` and `/mcp__pair__diagnose` forms also work. The extension
includes `skills/ai-pair-demo/SKILL.md` and `skills/ai-pair-diagnose/SKILL.md`;
copy their directories to your Claude `.claude/skills` directory to use
`/ai-pair-demo` and `/ai-pair-diagnose`. No skill is installed automatically.
The demo follows your speech setting; diagnostics do not run a paid preview.

### Be there for every keystroke

![The agent explains the update method in the Pair panel, then types it in the
editor](media/every-keystroke.gif)

Some of us, at least some of the time, want to understand our code at a deep
level. For that, handing a task to an agent and reviewing the diff that comes
back can be exhausting. With *AI Pair Programmer*, you're there for every
keystroke instead, and you end up knowing the code almost as if you'd typed it
yourself.

It's pair programming where your coding agent has the keyboard. It types in your
editor slowly enough to follow and explains what it's doing. Interrupt it
whenever you like, or take over and let it watch you for a change.

### Interrupt and steer

![The programmer asks the agent to fix its imports, and it adds them at the top
of the file](media/interrupt-and-steer.gif)

### Watch it change its mind in real time

![The agent writes a comment, reconsiders, deletes it, and documents the type
differently](media/change-its-mind.gif)

It's also a good way to learn a new technology, or to have the agent walk you
through code you don't know yet.

### Ask it to explain code line by line

![The agent walks through a function line by line, highlighting each line and
explaining it in the Pair panel](media/explain-line-by-line.gif)

It works in VS Code, with the coding agent you already use. Setup is built in
for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI and Cursor, and any agent that
supports MCP can be connected by hand.

**Note:** It works best with strong models; weaker ones tend to struggle with
this way of working.

## How to use it

Once the extension is [installed](#install) and [connected to your
agent](#connect-your-agent), keep using your agent as usual. When you want to
pair:

1.  Open the project in VS Code, and start your agent **in the same folder** (or
    a subfolder of it).
2.  Ask it to pair: *"Let's pair on adding a settings page."* In Claude Code,
    you can also run `/mcp__pair__start`. If you want to learn the technology
    too, say so: *"...I'm new to Svelte, explain as you go."* With Claude Code's
    CLI installed and set up, the **Pair** panel also offers **Start a
    session**: it starts Claude Code in a hidden terminal with the request
    already sent, and the Pair panel stays in front. The terminal closes when
    the session ends. Until the agent starts, the panel says a session is
    starting.
3.  The **Pair** panel opens in the secondary side bar, and the agent's cursor
    appears in your editor.

Anything you say or edit interrupts the agent, so its next move takes it into
account. While you pair:

| To... | Do this |
|---|---|
| say something to the agent | type in the reply box, press Enter. Typing pauses playback. In Settings, choose **Finish current action first** to wait for the action boundary; long commands can delay replies and Stop remains immediate. |
| ask about some code | select it in the editor, then reply: the selection goes along (**x** leaves it out) |
| let it run a command | **Run once**, **Allow this command**, **Allow all for session**, or **Skip**; **Show terminal** reveals the command's terminal |
| stop it right now | **Interrupt**, or just edit the code: any edit interrupts |
| look around | scroll or switch files. Playback pauses until you **Resume**, which brings you back to the agent's cursor |
| write a part yourself | **My turn**. The agent becomes the navigator and comments as you type. **Hand back** returns the turn, with your reply if you typed one |
| change the pace or code display | the speed menu (**1.0x**) sets the pace and chooses Typing, Lines, or Blocks for the next typing action |
| manage the reading pause | click the ring to finish; hold it to pause the countdown until release. Focus it and use Space for the same behavior |
| finish | **End**, or tell the agent you're done. You can pair again anytime |

Lines and Blocks show code in groups with a reading pause and highlight for
each group. Reading speed and the main pace adjust those pauses; click or hold
the reading ring to finish or pause one. Typing remains the default.

The status shows when playback is **Paused** or **Playing**. Reading pauses,
command confirmations, your turn and suspended sessions remain distinct. A
ready count shows accepted work that has not started, and completed command
results promptly reach a waiting agent. The cursor is yellow and pulsing when
the agent has just spoken and is waiting for you to read.

**Try it without an agent:** *AI Pair: Play Demo Session* plays a scripted
session that adds a small API to an Express app, which it creates in
`ai-pair-demo/`.

## How it works under the hood

```text
agent (Claude Code, ...) ── stdio MCP ──▶ pair-mcp ── local WebSocket ──▶ VS Code extension
```

The agent submits small batches of actions: say, move, select, type, newline,
delete, point, run. The extension plays them at a human pace and reports back exactly
what happened, including everything you did in the meantime. The agent plans its
next batch while you watch the current one, which hides most of its thinking
time. And it's never more than one batch ahead, so your interruptions land
immediately. Typing handles CRLF line endings consistently and preserves a
standalone carriage return. Structural newlines and single-close moves are
explicit choices; other typing remains literal.

The design is written up in:

-   [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md): the tools and their exact semantics, as the
    agent sees them.
-   [AGENT_GUIDE.md](AGENT_GUIDE.md): how the agent should pair, returned to it
    when a session starts.
-   [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md): what you see: the cursor, the panel, the timing.
-   [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md): the components and how they connect.

## Install

You need **VS Code 1.106 or newer**. Install the paired VSIX artifacts from
the same release as described in [Get started](#get-started). Reload the
window and restart the agent. Settings shows the running version and build ID.
**Copy diagnostics** explicitly copies bounded connection, session, request,
pause, and command status metadata; it does not include chat, code, paths,
command text, or output.

To build it from source instead, you also need **Node.js 22.19 or newer**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mattyv/ai-pair.git
cd ai-pair
npm install
npm run package
code --install-extension ai-pair-*.vsix
```

## Connect your agent

1.  **Open a project folder in VS Code.** The extension installs the MCP server
    your agent runs, at `~/.ai-pair/bin/pair-mcp`
    (`%USERPROFILE%\.ai-pair\bin\pair-mcp.cmd` on Windows). It runs on VS Code's
    own runtime, so it doesn't need Node.js.
2.  **Run *AI Pair: Set Up Agent*** from the command palette (VS Code also
    offers this the first time the extension starts). Pick your agents; the ones
    it finds installed are already checked. For each one, it adds a server named
    `pair` to that agent's user-wide MCP configuration, leaving everything else
    in the file as it was:

    | Agent | Where |
    |---|---|
    | **Claude Code** (the CLI, the IDE extensions, the Claude desktop app's Code tab) | `claude mcp add --scope user`, or `~/.claude.json` without the `claude` command |
    | **Codex** (the CLI, the IDE extension, the app) | `~/.codex/config.toml` (or in `$CODEX_HOME`) |
    | **OpenCode** | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (`.jsonc` if you have one), on Windows too |
    | **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
    | **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
    | **Another agent** | copies an MCP server configuration to the clipboard: a stdio server named `pair` running the launcher |

3.  **Restart your agent** so it picks up the new server.

## Calibrate your reading speed

The pause after each of the agent's messages is sized to the message, at a rate
per character. To set that rate to your own pace, run *AI Pair: Calibrate
Reading Speed*: the Pair panel shows a passage when you type `go`, you read it,
and you type `x` the moment you finish. The rate goes into `aiPair.timing` in
your settings. Asking the agent for another passage ("use the Rainbow Passage")
has it fetch the text and start the calibration with it.

## Settings

Commands use quiet terminals by default; **Show terminal** reveals one. If shell
integration is unavailable, the terminal opens so you can see the command.
Hidden terminals are not restored when the workspace is reopened.

The Pair panel's **Settings** button lets you choose the chat order. The default
shows the newest messages at the top; choose **Oldest first** to put new messages
and the reply box at the bottom. Your choice is saved across reloads.

| Setting | |
|---|---|
| `aiPair.showTerminalsAutomatically` | Show Pair command terminals automatically (default off); also available in Pair Settings. |
| `aiPair.codePlayback` | `typing` (default), `lines`, or `blocks`; also in the code display dropdown and Settings. Applies to the next typing action. |
| `aiPair.chatOrder` | `newestFirst` (default) or `oldestFirst`; also available in the Pair panel settings. |
| `aiPair.speed` | Overall playback speed, the follow scroll's glide included (the panel's speed menu offers 0.4x to 3.0x). |
| `aiPair.readingSpeed` | Reading speed: divides the reading pauses after narration and grouped code (the panel's reading menu offers 0.4x to 3.0x). |
| `aiPair.calibrationPassage` | The passage *AI Pair: Calibrate Reading Speed* times you on, as `{ "title": ..., "text": ..., "notice": ... }`; empty, the built-in one. The agent's `calibrate` tool writes it. |
| `aiPair.agentName` | The name on the agent's cursor. |
| `aiPair.timing` | Fine-tune any typing, pause, or glide duration, e.g. `{ "afterSelectMs": 900, "type": { "wordStartMs": 140 } }`. Every key is in [`timing.ts`](packages/core/src/timing.ts). |
| `aiPair.confirmCommands` | Ask before each command the agent runs in the terminal (default on). Turned off, the agent's commands run without any prompt, not even its own. |

## Rules for the agent

Rules you and the agent settle on can live in a file, so you don't repeat them
every session. When a session starts, the agent gets them after the pairing
guide, and the panel's "Session started" line names the files it was given:

-   `~/.ai-pair/GUIDE.md`: rules for every project.
-   `.ai-pair/GUIDE.md` in a project: rules for that project. Every one from the
    workspace folder down to the agent's working directory is read, outer first,
    and none above the workspace folder. One that git ignores is left out; one
    checked in always counts.

Later files take precedence over earlier ones, and all of them over the pairing
guide. Each is plain markdown, read up to 20,000 characters. A project's file
goes into the agent's instructions, the same trust an agent's own `CLAUDE.md` or
`AGENTS.md` gets.

## Troubleshooting

-   **The agent says `no_editor`.** Its working directory isn't inside a folder
    that's open in VS Code. Open that folder in VS Code, or start the agent in
    it.
-   **The agent doesn't have the pair tools.** Restart the agent after setting
    it up. *AI Pair: Set Up Agent* marks the agents that are set up. With Claude
    Code, `claude mcp list` should show `pair`.
-   **After updating the extension,** reload the VS Code window and restart the
    agent. A session in progress waits, suspended, and the agent's next `start`
    from the same folder resumes it.

### Releasing

Follow the [release checklist](RELEASE.md), including the README and
architecture review, paired artifacts, and verification evidence. The current
`npm run release` script publishes the main extension; the companion and
platform assets need separate checks.
